# The Problem

Implement a very simple game of battleships ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game) ). If you’ve never played the game, you can get a feel for it from this online flash game ( http://www.learn4good.com/games/board/battleship.htm ). You should create a simple console application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of battleships against the computer. The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

* 1x Battleship (5 squares)
* 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The application should accept input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was success, and additionally report on the sinking of any vessels.
